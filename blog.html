<p>I am retaking this class for a better grade and have no fear on my ability to rescomprehend the material again. 
I am already a little familiar with GitHub, never the less I am still learning new things form this class every day. 
One resource that I like using that I have noticed has not been introduced in jsfiddle. 
I have found the website to be very helpful in my earnings last semester.
