    <p>I would say I am about a 6 in my confidence to using html but what worries me the most is my ability to figure out what I am suppose to do in this class for assignments.</p>
   	<p>I hope to refine my skills in HTML, javascript and CSS.</p>
   	<p>Yes, I have signed up for Piazza.</p>
   	<p>I am a transfer student from Chemeketa Community college. Learning in my eyes is and always will be a constant; the only diffrence between now and my future is that I will be learning diffrent this in a diffrent way.</p>
